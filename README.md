# ewas-flood
EWAS-Flood is an Early Warning and Actuation System for Floods. This is the backend service for the whole platform.

# Need
Recently, we observed the haphazard situation in Mumbai during floods. The root causes of the floods are badly designed drainage 
systems and the lack of maintaining them. The water thus cannot be appropriately channelized resulting in inundation of the roads 
and low lying areas.

# Technologies Used
- web.py
- Postgresql
- Flask
- Bootstrap

_future tech stack below_

- MicroPython
- Celery
- Android
- Firebase Cloud Messaging

# ToDo
- Implementation of remaining API endpoints
- Celery for background task management
- Implementation of The Things Network over AWS IoT architecture
- Addition of Firebase Cloud Messaging to push notifications to Team Devices with rich Intents

Suggestions are welcome.
